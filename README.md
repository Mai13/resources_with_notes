# Resources with Notes
In this repo I'll update all the technical books I read with my notes on them. My carreer path is **Data Science**, so the resouces will be related to this field. There will be two main topics: **python** & **Machine Learing**

#### Deep Learning with PyTorch

Breif Introduction: PyTorch is an open source machine learning library based on the Torch library, used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing. It is primarily developed by Facebook's AI Research lab (FAIR). It is free and open-source software released under the Modified BSD license. Although the Python interface is more polished and the primary focus of development, PyTorch also has a C++ interface.
